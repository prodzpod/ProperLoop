# Proper Loop
> [PerfectedLoop2](https://thunderstore.io/package/arimah/PerfectedLoop/) included, free of charge! (satisfactory)

## Stage Calculation Changes
Changes how looping is calculated so that you're no longer able to desync the stages and primordial teleporters. (Such as primordial teleporter spawning at what's usually a stage 4 stage due to hidden realms such as Void Fields or Void Locus).
